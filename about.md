I am Marcus and I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), supervised by Thomas Bläsius.

I am interested in algorithms (mostly for hard problems), (parametrized) complexity, and understanding why hard problems sometimes are easy.
Also peripherally interested in Crypto and Machine Learning.
    

In my free time I like cycling, bouldering and making music.
I am a friend of the [CCC](http://www.ccc.de).
