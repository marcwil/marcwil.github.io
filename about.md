I am Marcus and I am studying Computer Science Master at Hasso Plattner Institute.

In CS my interests lie in theoretical computer science, machine learning and more recently homomorphic encryption.

In my free time I like cycling, bouldering and making music.
I am a friend of the [CCC](http://www.ccc.de).
